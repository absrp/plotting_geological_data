A Jupyter Notebook to plot scatter plots, line plots, histograms, spider plots, maps, time series, and kernel density plots of publicly available geological datasets.

## About The Project

## Plots generated
This is a list of the types of plots, and the data plotted in each of them in the Notebook. A cell where the data is loaded and prepared for plotting using pandas is provided before each plotting cell. 

- Line plot
  Two line plots on the same figure with twin y-axes, plotting insolation and temperature over time, showing how long-term changes in Earth’s orbit (insolation) relate to paleoclimate temperature changes over ~250,000 years
- Scatter plot
  Scatter plot in log log scale showing the density of fractures versus fault-perpendicular distance for cracks from the 2014 Balochistan earthquake.
- Histogram
  Histogram showing the global distribution of earthquake magnitude over the past month (catalog downloaded February 2, 2026).
- Map
  Basemap showing state boundaries, with the Colorado river and active fault traces plotted on top. The axes are limited to Utah, and four UT cities are plotted on top as scattered dots.
- REE spider plot
  Plot showing the concentration of REE elements in several samples from the Deccan Traps.
- Detrital Zircon U–Pb age distribution
  Kernel density plots showing the distribution U-Pb ages for different samples from Alaska.
- Earthquake time series
  Two subplot showing the distribution of earthquake magnitude (top) and cumulative number of earthquakes (bottom) versus time, capturing the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes.


## Data requirements
All data required to generate the plots is provided in the zip file. The references and web links for the data are provided at the bottom of the Notebook.
